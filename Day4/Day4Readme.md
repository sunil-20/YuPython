* remove() is used to remove the first occurrence of a specific value from a list.
* You specify the value you want to remove, not the index.
* It does not return the removed element; it only modifies the list in place.
* If the value you're trying to remove is not in the list, it raises a ValueError.

### pop() method:
* pop() method:
* pop() is used to remove and return an element from a list based on its index.
* You specify the index of the element you want to remove.
* It returns the removed element.
* If you don't specify an index, it removes and returns the last element by default.
