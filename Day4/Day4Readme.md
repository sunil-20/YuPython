It does not return the removed element; it only modifies the list in place.
If the value you're trying to remove is not in the list, it raises a ValueError.

### pop() method:
pop() method:
pop() is used to remove and return an element from a list based on its index.
You specify the index of the element you want to remove.
It returns the removed element.
If you don't specify an index, it removes and returns the last element by default.
