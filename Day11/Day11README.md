To sum the values of a list in Python, you can use a loop to iterate through the list and add up its elements, or you can use the built-in `sum()` function. Here are both methods:

Method 1: Using a Loop

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
total = 0

for num in my_list:
    total += num

print("The sum of the list is:", total)
```

Method 2: Using the `sum()` Function

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
total = sum(my_list)

print("The sum of the list is:", total)
```

Both of these methods will calculate the sum of the values in the list `my_list` and print the result. You can replace `my_list` with your own list of values.
